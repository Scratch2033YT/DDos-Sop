# DDoS Sop
literrally a ddos tool for android
Tested in Pydroid

# Information
while some ddos work in termux, f-droid termux is in a website, which some of you guys can't trust the site. for this project, the app is on Google play store and app store (i think) so you don't need any errors, filling up your disk with packages, just an app and a one file can help you.
Thanks for downloading!
THE APP IS 100% SAFE AND I TRIED IT,
THE SCRIPT IS 100% SAFE AND IF YOU GET DDOSED DON'T CONTACT ME.
ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSSES ONLY. DO NOT DDOS INNOCENT PEOPLE!
